# Quant Basics 101

## Part 1 : The Basics


```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
```

### 1.1 Introduction

We have at our disposal $$N_t^{\$}$$ dollars to invest. <br />

We must determine how much to invest in each asset on each day $$t$$ : meaning the individual quantities $$x^{i}_t$$ to be invested at the close.<br />

For the sake of simplicity, we don't considerate investing in risk-free rate. <br />

The individual quantities $$x^{i}_t$$ could be positive or negative allowing short positions (the possibility of not owning the asset but selling it). <br /> Those quantities in dollars could be missleading so we prefer percentages : <br />

$$x_{t}^{i} = N_{t}^{\$} . w^{i}_{t}$$

with:
- $$x_{t}^{i}$$ : Allocation
- $$N_{t}^{\$}$$ : Notional
- $$w^{i}_{t}$$ : Fraction


$$x_{t}^{i}$$ is the amount of dollars invested in a single asset $$S^{i}$$ and the number of shares to hold is given by :

$$n_{t}^{i} = \frac{x_{t}^{i}}{S_{t}^{i}} = \frac{N_{t}^{\$} . w^{i}_{t}}{S_{t}^{i}}$$


```python
N_0 = 100_000_000 # Initial Capitalization
n = 3 # 3 assets
S_0 = np.array([53.0, 121.0, 93.0])

print(f"N_0 is at $${N_0} equal-weighted on {n} assets that have 3 different stock prices {S_0[0]}, {S_0[1]} and {S_0[2]}.")

w_0 = np.ones(n) / n # Equal weighted between three assets
x_0 = N_0 * w_0

n_0 = x_0 / S_0

print(f"The number of shares holded initially in our portfolio is {n_0[0]:.2f} for the asset S_1, {n_0[1]:.2f} for the asset S_2 and {n_0[2]:.2f} for the asset S_3.")
```

    N_0 is at $$100000000 equal-weighted on 3 assets that have 3 different stock prices 53.0, 121.0 and 93.0.
    The number of shares holded initially in our portfolio is 628930.82 for the asset S_1, 275482.09 for the asset S_2 and 358422.94 for the asset S_3.


Our notional at disposal is not necessarily : $$\sum | w_{t}^{i} | = 1$$ but could be $$\sum | w_{t}^{i} | > 1$$ is we decide to apply some leverage on our strategy.

Leveraging is short selling stocks we don't have creating an excedent of capital.

### Short Portfolio with a leverage of 110%


```python
w_0_short = np.array([0.5, -0.4, 0.2])

x_0 = N_0 * w_0_short

n_0 = x_0 / S_0

leverage = np.sum(np.abs(w_0_short)) * 100

print(f"The leverage is {leverage:.2f}%")
print(f"The number of shares holded initially in our portfolio is {n_0[0]:.2f} for the asset S_1, {n_0[1]:.2f} for the asset S_2 and {n_0[2]:.2f} for the asset S_3")
```

    The leverage is 110.00%
    The number of shares holded initially in our portfolio is 943396.23 for the asset S_1, -330578.51 for the asset S_2 and 215053.76 for the asset S_3


On the next day, considering that delta is one-day period and only looking at the closing prices, here is what's going to happen on the Profits \& Loss (P\&L): 

$$ P\&L^{i}(t, \delta) = n_{t}^{i} . \delta S_{t}^{i} = N_{t}^{\$} . w^{i}_{t}\frac{(S_{t+\delta}^{i} - S_{t}^{i})}{S_{t}^{i}} =  N_{t}^{\$}.w^{i}_{t}.r_{t}^{i}$$

with $$r_{t}^{i}$$ the return over that $$\delta$$ period of time on that given asset.

### Computation of the P&L for the long-only portfolio and the leveraged one :


```python
S_1 = np.array([52.0, 118.0, 94.0]) # prices one day later

returns = S_1 / S_0 - 1

PnL_long = np.sum(N_0 * w_0 * returns) 
print(f"P&L on the long only portfolio = $${PnL_long:.2f}")

PnL_leverage = N_0 * w_0_short @ returns # dot-product
print(f"P&L on the long-short portfolio = $${PnL_leverage:.2f}")
```

    P&L on the long only portfolio = $$-1096954.16
    P&L on the long-short portfolio = $$263393.07


The goal is to design a set of quantitative rules that would be used daily to determine the allocation weights $$w_{t}^{i}$$ to 'maximize' the P&L $$\sum_{S^{i}} w_{t}^{i} r_{t}^{i}$$

### 1.2 Follow the past to create a strategy

#### Risk : Volatility

$$\sigma_t (\{w^i\}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_T - 1} \sum_{j=1}^{N_T} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} w^i r^i (t_j, \delta t) - \mu_{\text{portfolio}} \right)^2 }$$

```python
volatility_portfolio = np.std(returns_rebalanced @ w_0, axis=1, ddof=1) # unbiased variance

volatility_portfolio
```

    array([0.00202877, 0.01193667])

### Sharpe ratio :

```python
sharpe_ratio = mu_portfolio / volatility_portfolio
sharpe_ratio
```

    array([-0.75599928, -0.19173586])


This post introduced the fundamental concepts of quantitative investing, from portfolio allocation to risk assessment. In future posts, we will explore advanced strategies like factor investing and machine learning-based allocation.
