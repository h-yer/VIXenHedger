### "Why Foxes Are Better Forecasters Than Hedgehogs?"

Volatility is my playground, and rough vol is my game. As a **Rough Vol Trader** at **OnlyFunds**, I navigate the chaos of options markets, seeking edge in the non-linear dance of implied volatility. Inspired by the **VIX Index** and the art of uncertainty, I blend quantitative research with intuitive market feel—because, as any fox knows, adaptability is the key to survival.

## Education

Your **typical French quant researcher** with a penchant for stochastic calculus, martingale theory, and exotic derivatives pricing. I cut my teeth on partial differential equations and Monte Carlo simulations before realizing that the real market is never as clean as the models suggest.

## Professional Experience

Currently trading volatility at **OnlyFunds**, designing systematic strategies that embrace market turbulence rather than fear it.
